# Size Of Universe

## Story

One day, while I was surfing the internet, my brother came and...

Him: How many light years do you think the size of the universe is?<br>
Me: Dunno.<br>
Him: The answer is 93 billion light years.<br>
Me: It didn't sound very big when you said it like that.<br>
Him: laugh*</p>

And then we wanted to see that big number in kilometers with calculators from the internet.

We encountered this:

```math
93ly = 8.798480e+14km
```

Of course **ly** stands for **light year** and as you can see, there is an expression like `e+14` at the end of the number. This means **10 to the 14th power** ðŸ˜¶ That means
there are **10 to the 14th power** times zero. Yes, unbelievable. What? Is this number too small for you? Then try this program out!

## Purpose of the Program

First of all it writes 8.798480 to a file. Then 1. And then 10 to the 14th power times 0. Finally it writes 'km'. The result file is `output.txt` right next to the executed Java file.

## Have I tried?

Yes, but when I saw the GBs I got scared and turned it off. I've seen 4 GB max. And I'm sure we're not even halfway there yet.

## Breaking the Computer (not really)

I took some small precautions to prevent the computer from breaking down. The program warns you whenever it writes 128 MB, 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB. If you are not afraid or you already know that a problem will not arise, you can try. And maybe you can see how many kilometers the observable universe covers...

## Installation Requirements

I used JDK 18 while writing this program, but an older JDK version will probably work as well.

## Compiling & Running

Since it is a terminal-based program, there is no need for third-party libraries. So compiling is super simple.

```bash
$ javac SizeOfUniverse.java
```

It's even easier to execute.

```bash
$ java SizeOfUniverse
```

The program will send you warnings for some file sizes. It's up to you whether to continue or not.

## So What We Earned?

- Incredibly large file size
- Understanding how big the universe is
- A little math knowledge
- Zeros
- Zeros
- And zeros...
